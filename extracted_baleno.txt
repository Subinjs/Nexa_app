CRAFTED FUTURISM DESIGN LANGUAGE
Signifying NEXA’s endeavour to create the cars of tomorrow, 
the New Age Baleno is the ﬁrst model to feature NEXA’s 
Crafted Futurism design language. A work of art inspired by 
the future, the design language is exclusively crafted to 
match the reﬁned tastes of NEXA customers. The design 
philosophy manifests itself across three major pillars.
• 
NEXpression
 
A Trendsetter expression that guides the overall design
& signature elements such as the Headlamps, NEXWave 
Grille, NEXTre’ LED DRLs and Alloys.
• 
NEXtech
 
Technologies that create a wow. Advanced features 
catering to the new age customer’s needs.
• 
NEXperience
 
Exclusive NEXperiences that are truly about driving a NEXA 
car that are delightful for both driver and the passengers.
TECH GOES BOLD
Looks like the boldest ever. Feels like a revolution. 
Sounds like an immersive theatre. Connects like a 
Smartphone. And watches over like an Eagle. It more 
than meets the eye and expectations. It is designed to 
take your driving experience to a whole new dimension. 
Welcome to “sensorial driving”. Welcome aboard to the 
New Age Baleno.

DAPPER GOES BOLD
The bold showstoppers’ dynamic stance, strong 
shoulders, and sharp character lines easily get 
hearts racing. Its geography has history, as its 
deﬁant body inherits the aesthetic Liquid Flow 
Design, throughout. The new NEXWave Grille with 
accentuated chrome strip gives the Baleno a 
wide and aggressive look. The LED Projector 
Headlamps with NEXTre’ LED DRLs and Rear 
Combination Lights could attract anyone at first 
glance. And in the second, they would ﬁnd 
themselves behind its wheel.

COMFORT GOES BOLD
You might want to keep going till the sun comes out. That’s why we have reimagined driving comfort for you. Immerse yourself into the state-of-the art cabin crafted with sleek 
chrome accentuation with smooth and natural ﬂow lines along with strong and expressive deep curves on the dashboard. Specially designed to make the person driving the 
Baleno feel like one with the car. Bask in the glory of the Dual-tone Interiors with Piano Black inserts. Sit back and relax in the lap of the new seats with extra deep curves and 
‘wrap around’ design which give you that added comfort.

INTELLIGENCE GOES BOLD
The feel of driving the Baleno is pure thrill. It is 
Intuitive. Instinctive. And sensorial. You might 
get goosebumps as you see the Head Up Display 
gently popping up for the ﬁrst time. Or the 3D 
views of the 360 View Camera, giving you a total 
look of your surroundings.
360 VIEW CAMERA 
The New Age Baleno is the ﬁrst premium 
hatchback in India to introduce 360 View Camera. 
Experience the ease of driving and parking in tight 
spaces with multiple view modes (3 each for front 
and back) to choose from according to your own 
convenience. It also offers 3D views of the 
complete vehicle surroundings as well. Moreover, 
the Approaching Object Detection (AOD) intuitively 
alerts you, when deemed necessary. This is not all, 
the steering based dynamic grid-lines smartly 
pave the way for you, into the spot.
The New Age Baleno introduces Head Up Display 
for the ﬁrst time in its segment. Enjoy driving in 
the city without taking your eyes off the road. 
Check the Turn by turn navigation, Speed, RPM, 
Fuel Economy, AC functions, and Warning 
notiﬁcations in colour with multi-display options 
in your line of sight. You can also adjust the 
brightness and angle of the HUD, as per your 
convenience and seat position.
HEAD UP DISPLAY
CONVENIENCE GOES BOLD
This bold premium hatch is heavily loaded with 
key features that enhance passenger comfort and 
make the car highly functional. It has Rear AC 
vents, Rear USB Type A and Type C Fast charging 
ports that are the best in its segment. It also has a 
sliding center Armrest for additional driving 
comfort. The popular Auto Gear Shift (5AGS) makes 
your drives smoother in the city amidst the trafﬁc. 
It also allows you to seamlessly choose between 
automatic and manual transmission. 
Additionally, when you switch to Cruise Control, it 
intelligently keeps the vehicle at a constant speed 
and you just sit back and enjoy the experience of 
sensorial driving. And for all those hazy days and 
misty nights, the LED Fog lamps come really handy 
to enhance visibility.

K series Dual Jet Dual VVT Engine with ISS (Idle Start 
Stop) technology to give you a bold and sensorial

system to provide an air-fuel ratio that ensures 
superior performance, and fuel efﬁciency. The 
system offers enhanced safety with stainless steel 
pipes and joints to avoid corrosion and leakage in 
the entire CNG structure. Integrated wire harnesses 
are used to eliminate short-circuiting and a 
microswitch ensures that the vehicle does not start 
during CNG fuel ﬁlling process.

Curtain). No matter what the weather conditions 
are, the signiﬁcantly enhanced stability of the 
vehicle ensure a pleasurable driving experience.

ESP with Hill Hold Assist, which prevents the loss 
of traction on all wheels. ESP helps in improved 
vehicle control during cornering, immediate lane 
change to avoid obstacles & provides more 
stability while driving on uneven or broken 
roads. The New Age Baleno also gets enhanced 
high speed straight line stability as well as 
better steering returnability, and enhanced 
braking for greater control on your bold drives. 
In addition to that, the Baleno is also loaded

Belt reminder for all occupants, Rear Parking 
Assist Sensors & many more safety features.

LIFESTYLE GOES BOLD
The beautiful tarmac at night. The blurry city 
lights in hindsight. And an immersive groovy 
music to set the vibe right. You look dapper and 
the wheel is between your hands. There’s an 
open road in front of you. You spot the green 
light. Push the pedal down to let the engine tell 
the night that you are afraid of nothing. You are 
the king of the bold times. And the night and its 
nightlife belong to you.
