Sometimes there are no roads to where you 
need to go. No maps for where you need to be. 
On such paths is where you often hear the tales 
of the Jimny. Tales that have been passed down 
from generation to generation since 1970. Tales 
of overcoming insurmountable odds. Tales of 
resilience. Tales of the ones who wouldn’t stop, 
wouldn’t turn back, and their Jimny.
These are the tales that have inspired each 
generation of the Jimny to venture deeper, climb 
higher and go further than ever before. In its all 
new 5-door avatar, the Jimny takes this driving 
experience to an all-new level.
 
TALES FROM THE TRAILS
THE 1ST GENERATION 1970
The Jimny was born tough. A worthy 
contender in the league of large 
and high-displacement off-roaders. 
It broke every stereotype, creating a 
niche for itself among high-adrenaline 
enthusiasts who dared to do 
the unimaginable.  
THE 2ND GENERATION 1981
The iconic Gypsy that became the pin-up 
of the 80s, owes its oomph to the
Second Generation Jimny. Ahead of its 
time, it strutted both paved city roads and 
unpaved wilderness with its jaw-dropping 
design. Making heads turn, of every 
person and animal it encountered.
THE 3RD GENERATION 1998
With its spirit to rough it out intact, this 
Jimny was designed for a higher degree 
of comfort. The smooth aerodynamic 
design, longer wheelbase and reﬁned 
rigid suspension, were breakthroughs 
that kept this Jimny at the top of its 
game for two decades.
THE 4TH GENERATION 2018
Making its predecessors proud, this Jimny 
went out there being the best version of 
itself. Chiselled to perfection, inside and 
out, it conquered the most treacherous 
tracks in style. Setting new off-roading 
goals across the globe.
An adventurer once picked the Jimny as his travel 
companion on his African odyssey. They traversed 
the continent’s length and breadth, scaling ﬁve of 
its highest peaks, including Mt. Kilimanjaro.

Going back 900,000 years was never going to be 
easy. Until the Jimny tore through the unforgiving 
terrain to reach the Pit of Bones, an archaeological 
site. It went where no other vehicle could, to 
unearth history and become a part of it.
-2019, Pit of Bones, Spain
As Storm Filomena raged across Madrid, the Jimny 
became the rescue vehicle of choice. It pulled out 
many stalled vehicles. It even drove through three 
feet of snow to deliver a new-born baby and the 
family back to the warmth of their home.

SOME SAY, YOU CAN'T KEEP
THE JIMNY AWAY FROM A STORY
The all-new 5-door Jimny has off-roading in 
its veins, with a spirit of adventure amped-up to 
match yours. Start from where you last stopped. 
Tread higher and navigate deeper into the 
untrodden. All the way towards the edge of 
the impossible and then, beyond. Without ever 
stopping to look behind.
INHERIT A RICH LEGACY 
INSPIRE A TRUE STORY 
The Jimny has been on a long journey down the evolutionary 
road. Selected by nature for the harshest conditions, it has seen 
and survived the worst. Only getting tougher with experience as 
its teacher. 
A STORY PASSED DOWN 
FOUR GENERATIONS
ENGINE PERFORMANCE
When you are setting forth into the 
unknown, the responsive 1.5L K15B 
engine powers you through. Built for 
off-roading, it generates strong torque 
throughout a wide RPM range for 
unstoppable performance. 
LADDER FRAME CHASSIS
Every Jimny owes its off-roading 
prowess to the Ladder Frame structure. 
Now, it’s your turn to put it to the test. 
Pick your terrain. A thoroughbred 
off-roader, the torsional rigidity of this 
chassis instils conﬁdence in the driver 
to master the toughest of topographies. 
While the full-width rigid axles in both 
the front and the rear, keeps you going 
like a mountain goat on the most 
impassable roads. 
The long-stroke 3-link suspension is teamed 
with full-width rigid axles in both the front 
and rear. This coupled with less variation in 
ground clearance and high tyre grounding 
force enables you to conquer the toughest 
of terrains. With the rigid axle suspension, 
when an obstacle pushes one wheel up, the 
axle presses the other down, to increase 
tyre contact in rough road conditions.
3-LINK RIGID
AXLE SUSPENSION
WITH COIL SPRING
Unlock a new level of off-roading with 
ALLGRIP PRO’s low range transfer gear. 
As you switch lanes from the paved to 
the unpaved, shift the transfer lever 
from 2H to 4H on the ﬂy. With max 
torque and traction on your side, the 
harshest terrain turns into a joy ride as 
you engage the 4L mode (Low Range 
Transfer Gear). With ALLGRIP PRO, 
every terrain will bow before you.
The extremities of nature weren't designed for 
vehicles. However, we've sculpted one to tread the 
most non-motorable of roads. Go up against 
jagged rocks, navigate treacherous passes or drive 
into a strong current. The Jimny is unrelenting in 
its pursuit of daredevil stories. 
OFF-ROAD PERFORMANCE 
TO CONQUER ANY FEAR
AMPLE BODY ANGLE AND CLEARANCE
Take outdoor exploration to a whole new degree. 
With ample departure and approach angles, you're 
ready to climb up steep slopes. While the wide ramp 
breakover angle and high ground clearance let you 
take on every obstacle on the way.

COMMANDING VIEW
The Jimny is all about tackling the toughest 
terrains and for that, you need to see what lies 
ahead of you. The upright A-pillars and ﬂat 
clamshell bonnet structure ensure a wide, 
unobstructed view, and helps you understand 
the relative position of the vehicle better. 
The Jimny’s solid underpinnings allow it to not just 
take on unforgiving terrain, but to cruise through it. 
Come what may, it can brave nature’s fury, no matter 
what form it takes.
EASY ON THE EYES
EASIER ON THE TERRAIN
LED HEADLAMPS WITH WASHER
The headlamps are as iconic as they are effective with 
washers that allow you to trudge through mud, dirt or 
snow without an ounce of doubt.
PRACTICAL DRIP RAIL
The drip rail running along the side and rear edges of 
the roof provides for ﬂexible installation of roof 
carriers. It can also keep your head dry and your spirits 
bright when entering and exiting by helping to prevent 
water from dripping off the roof.
OPTIMISED BUMPERS
The Jimny’s angled bumper edges increase clearance at the 
wheels, enabling it to dodge obstacles at will. This is 
complemented by the use of tough-textured black material 
for bumpers, ensuring no harm comes from stone chips 
and scratches.
The ability to power through the roughest terrains is embedded in 
the Jimny’s DNA. Like a soldier who treads forth despite the odds. 
Its simplicity has been instrumental in driving people to the 
extraordinary and back. With stories that have become legends 
over time. This isn't just a car. It’s a conqueror’s steed. 
BEAUTY’S MOST TIMELESS FORM?
SIMPLICITY
INTUITIVELY DESIGNED CONTROLS
This mean machine is curated to help you focus on overcoming 
the terrain. From the switches to the dials and touchscreen controls, 
everything is designed for easy operation even when you’re tackling rough 
terrain while wearing gloves.
COMFORTABLE SEAT DESIGN
The terrain might not be forgiving but the drive will always be memorable. Thanks to the comfortable 
seats designed for shock absorption. 
You won’t always drive on smooth roads. 
In fact, chances are, you might not drive on roads at 
all. That’s why the horizontal pattern deﬁned by the 
instrument panel and vertical lines characterised 
by the meter cluster, help you recognize the angle 
of the vehicle on uneven terrains.
The rich intense black interiors ensure that your 
focus is on the path ahead (or lack of it). The 
textures used on the instrument panel resemble a 
high-class, SLR camera, that helps conceal small 
scratches and suppresses distracting reﬂections.

With Brake LSD 
While pushing the limits of adventure, safety is
a priority. Equipped with NEXA’s safety shield, 
the Jimny's got your back on every track you tread.
Be it on city streets or in the wilderness. The thrill
of the ride is only possible with peace of mind with
6 airbags that come standard across all variants.
YOUR SAFETY HARNESS 
FOR EVERY TERRAIN 
6 AIRBAGS
To keep your spirit of adventure going, the new 
Jimny comes equipped with six airbags. In the 
front and along the sides. To safeguard you against 
every eventuality.
BRAKE LIMITED SLIP DIFFERENTIAL
The ground beneath you is not always as ﬁrm as your resolve. 
In such times, the Jimny's Brake LSD feature comes to the 
rescue. On slippery tracks, if two diagonal wheels lose their 
grip, this feature automatically pumps the brakes on the 
slipping wheels and redistributes the torque to 
the other two wheels. So, you tread on relentlessly. 
HILL HOLD ASSIST
Up your off-roading game as you set out to conquer a new 
peak. The Hill Hold function prevents the vehicle from 
rolling backwards, even as your foot moves from the brake 
to the accelerator pedal. On bumpy slopes that vary on 
the right and left side, the feature ensures the only way 
you go is forward.
The ﬁnal descent is the most treacherous. Activate 
the Hill Descent function at the push of a button and 
we've got your back. The system allows you to control 
vehicle speed on descents using the accelerator pedal 
only, so you can focus on steering and the breathtaking 
view before you. 
HILL DESCENT CONTROL
 
 
Get off the grid. Away from the distractions of social media. Let your solitary self emerge
like the alpha on a journey of self-exploration. On the way, the Jimny connects you to tech that matters.
The intuitively designed 22.86cm (9”) SmartPlay Pro+ or the 17.78cm (7”) SmartPlay Pro pairs wirelessly
with your smartphone via Android Auto# and Apple CarPlay#. Surround Sense with ARKAMYS enhances
the audio experience offering signature ambiences to suit every mood. 
UNPLUGGED ADVENTURES BOLSTERED BY TECH
There's a side to you that's uncorrupted by convention. 
Primal by nature, it craves to go back to where it belongs. 
The Jimny transports you there. Along with the tools you 
need to nurture this persona. You’ll have ample space to 
store them thanks to the large boot space. A wider rear 
opening also ensures you can load and unload with ease. 
It comes equipped with hook screws to secure your tools 
and a luggage box to stow away your used wares. Your 
jack and wrench are easily accessible from the toolbox. 
The front seats go all the way back, doubling up as beds. 
There's space to secure your phone and bottle for those 
in the front seats. Along with a ﬂoor console for 
additional storage. So it doesn't matter if you're a light 
packer or gearing up for the long haul. Go where your 
heart takes you and script a new story.

where the tech takes centre stage.
NEXtech
Driving a NEXA car should be an experience like no 
other. Something that the Jimny has boasted of for 
more than ﬁve decades. A rich legacy that will be 
passed on for generations to come.
NEXperience
 
ADAPT | EVOLVE | BECOME
Since its inception in 2015, NEXA has always 
been about creating new experiences, be it 
through new designs, products or technologies. 
With our core values rooted in innovation, 
evolution is inevitable. The Jimny is no 
exception. Seeped in the NEXA philosophy, 
its innovations in design, experience and tech, 
make it a true off-roader’s dream come true.
The NEXA philosophy rests on three major 
pillars. And the Jimny, with its down-to-earth 
ruggedness, holds them up with the same ease 
it veers off-road. 
CRAFTED FUTURISM
If there’s one thing the Jimny stands for, it’s Purity of 
Expression. With functional and robust authenticity used in 
design, it wards off any distractions and keeps you focused 
on the road ahead. The unique fascia adorned by multi-slot 
accentuated grille, iconic headlamps and upright-body 
structure keep the spirit of the ﬁrst-gen Jimny truly alive.
NEXpression
The Jimny comes in a variety of colours, designed keeping function in mind. It ranges from conspicuous 
body colours to low visibility body colours. None is more iconic than the Kinetic Yellow. The Kinetic Yellow 
is inspired by adventure safety jackets and is for adrenaline junkies who need high visibility in their 
pursuit of adventure. The Jimny also features 6 more colours ranging from NEXA Blue to Pearl Arctic White, 
comprising a palette that has something for everyone. However, like a true off-roader, it looks at its 
majestic best when covered in dust and mud in the aftermath of its latest adventure.
