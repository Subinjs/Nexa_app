## ✅ Your Feature Files Status

All your original feature files in `data/*_features.json` have been **preserved** with the correct engine specs you provided earlier.

The extracted brochure data is saved in:
- `additional_features.json` - Complete JSON format
- This README - Human-readable summary

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

You can now manually add any features you want from the extracted data to your comparison feature by:

1. **Display these features in the comparison table** (already possible with current code)
2. **Add filter options** (filter by features like "Has Sunroof", "6 Airbags", etc.)
3. **Create a features comparison view** separate from price comparison

---

## 💡 Quick Implementation

Your current code already supports showing any data in the feature JSON files. The comparison will automatically display safety, comfort, and technology features if you add them to the JSON files.

**No code changes needed** - just update the JSON files with the features you want to show!
